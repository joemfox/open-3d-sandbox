##What am I doing?

You should be looking at a simple 3-D scene with two models in it. One of the models should have textures. The other should be spinning.

Play with the code and see what things do! Don't worry — you won't break anything. 
Here are some suggestions:
• Change one of the models into something else
• Change the color of something
• Change the size of something
• Make something move
• Make the camera move
• Add a new object
• Add or remove lighting
• Change the lighting color
• Animate the lights
• Make it do something when the user clicks
• Add a texture to an object
• Make shiny objects
• Make a loop that creates new objects

Having trouble figuring any of these out? Ask for help!
