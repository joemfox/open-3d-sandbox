Open 3D Sandbox
======

Download this repo and navigate to its folder in your terminal.
To start the scene, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and go to `localhost:8000/scene.html` in your browser.

(If you're a python3 person run `python3 -m http.server` instead)

##What am I doing?

You should be looking at a simple 3-D scene with two models in it. One of the models should have textures. The other should be spinning.

Play with the code and see what things do! Don't worry â€” you won't break anything. 
Here are some suggestions:

	1. Change one of the models into something else
	2. Change the color of something
	3. Change the size of something
	4. Make something move
	5. Make the camera move
	6. Add a new object
	7. Add or remove lighting
	8. Change the lighting color
	9. Animate the lights
	10. Make it do something when the user clicks
	11. Add a texture to an object
	12. Make shiny objects
	13. Make a loop that creates new objects

Having trouble figuring any of these out? Ask for help!
