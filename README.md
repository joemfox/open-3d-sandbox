Open 3D Sandbox
======

Download this repo and navigate to its folder in your terminal.
To start the scene, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and go to `localhost:8000/scene.html` in your browser.

##What am I doing?

You should be looking at a simple 3-D scene with two models in it. One of the models should have textures. The other should be spinning.

##What am I supposed to do with this?

Play with the code and see what things do! Don't worry â€” you won't break anything. Here are some suggestions:
1. See if you can change one of the models into something else
2. Change the color of something
3. Change the size of something
4. Make something move
5. Make the camera move
6. Add a new object
7. Add or remove lighting
8. Change the lighting color
9. Animate the lights
10. Make it do something when the user clicks

Having trouble figuring any of these out? Ask for help!
